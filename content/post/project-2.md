title: "Superliga season 2019/20 squads distribution of time played by age"
---

How playing time of players is distributed in Superliga Argentina squads. The teams are organized by their final position in the league. It also gives information about the average age of each team and how many points they were able to sum. The leagues average is 25.7 years old.  

Although the league of Argentina has an export profile, most teams can hold players in their prime age (25.7 yrs old average age). 

The viz singles out two teams, Talleres and Velez, which are doing a great work in their youth levels and are giving minutes to their young players.
