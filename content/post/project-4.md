title: "Champions League squad pressures in season 2019/20"
---

How champions league (season 2019/20) qualified squads like to pressure in three different zones of the pitch. The dataset was scraped from FBref. 

FBref describes pressures as “number of times applying pressure to opposing player who is receiving, carrying or releasing the ball in 1/3 of the pitch”. Dividing each value by the total number of pressures made, we calculate the percentage applied in each third of the field.
